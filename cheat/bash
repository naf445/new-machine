# Topic
Port forwarding, speifically of a jupyter server from a remote machine to local

At a high level, we will spin up a jupyter server on a certain port on a remote machine,
then we will forward that port to our local machine.

# Examples
- SSH in to remote machine, probably EC2 instance
- Open up a persistent terminal session (using screen or tmux)
- Might need to activate virtual or conda env with jupyter installed
- Open a jupyter server and forward it to a specific port!
- You may need to get the token presented by the command
'jupyter notebook --port=<PORTNUM>'

- Switch to local machine terminal, open a port forward:
'ssh -L PORTNUM:localhost:PORTNUM user@serveripaddress' 

- In local browser go to below, may have to paste token
'http://localhost:PORTNUM'

- To see jupyter notebook servers running:
'jupyter notebook list'
